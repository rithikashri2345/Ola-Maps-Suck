50% of the responses are empty for Ola Maps api. Maybe a side project but definitely not for production and start ups.

To run, go to https://maps.olakrutrim.com/ and generate the API key and repace it with the api_key variable in get_ola_maps_equests.py
Navigate to your directory and run: 
```python loop_equests.py``` 
Print output and use as needed with response variable. Currently, it gives random latitude and longitude values to send data from offet of base value in Banglore coordinates.
